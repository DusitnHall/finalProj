I ultimately wanted to create a encryption/decryption program to change any file type for this assignment.

This project was interesting to me because I had developed this encryption method on my own, but it took a really long time to do it by hand.
Building a computer to do it for me is something I have always thought about doing.

I ended up being successful in everything that I set out to do. If I were to continue this project though I would find ways to make it run faster.

During this project I learned about byte manipulation in a file. I also created a wrap funtion that I will likely use for future projects. 
I gained a better understanding of char and hex values and learned how to maniplulate them. 



I used a byte array to retrieve the byte data from the file to be converted into a string.

I used a list to hold the hex values after they had been converted from a string to an integer.

I used an if/else statement to wrap a number between an upper and lower bound.

I used two different methods to encrypt and decrypt the file, this allowed me to read where it was being encrypted or decrypted more easily in my code. 

I used another method to find the files in a file directory as well as a method to wrap an integer between an upper and lower bound. I used the wrap method in multiple places which made it useful as a method.

I used a while loop in my wrap method to wrap the number while it is outside of the boundries. 

I used a for loop in multiple places in my encrypt/decrypt methods. This allowed me to change each individual byte that I was reading from the file without writing a line for each one.

I used a foreach loop to print out each file in my chosen directory when finding the file the user wanted.

I read bytes from the file of the users choice to create the data to be altered.

After my program finished running I wrote the changed data back to the file.
