I ultimately wanted to create a encryption/decryption program to change any file type for this assignment.

This project was interesting to me because I had developed this encryption method on my own, but it took a really long time to do it by hand.
Building a computer to do it for me is something I have always thought about doing.

I ended up being successful in everything that I set out to do. If I were to continue this project though I would find ways to make it run faster.

During this project I learned about byte manipulation in a file. I also created a wrap funtion that I will likely use for future projects. 
I gained a better understanding of char and hex values and learned how to maniplulate them.
